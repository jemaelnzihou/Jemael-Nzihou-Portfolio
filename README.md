## 📐 Governing Physics (Engineering Form)

**Heat diffusion (1D, transient):**

```
∂T/∂t = α · ∂²T/∂x²
```

Where:

* `T(x,t)` = temperature
* `α = k / (ρ · cₚ)` = thermal diffusivity

**Boundary conditions:**

```
T(0,t) = 0
T(1,t) = 0
```

**Initial condition:**

```
T(x,0) = sin(πx)
```

**Analytical validation solution:**

```
T(x,t) = exp(-α·π²·t) · sin(πx)
```

This project develops an **AI-driven pass/fail risk prediction system** using real semiconductor process sensor data.  
The objective is to **identify yield risk before downstream metrology**, enabling:

- Earlier intervention  
- Higher throughput  
- Improved fab stability  

---

## 🎯 Business & Engineering Objective

### Problem Statement

---

## 🧠 Dataset Description

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository – SECOM Dataset  

| Attribute | Value |

### *From Constitutional Promises to Measurable Outcomes*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **data science, statistical modeling, and natural language processing (NLP)** to evaluate whether real-world institutional outcomes align with the **constitutional obligations defined in official government oaths**.

Public institutions in the United States—**military, law enforcement, judiciary, and civil government**—derive their authority from oaths sworn to the U.S. Constitution.
