# 📊 Project 1: Oath–Outcome Alignment Analysis  
### *From Constitutional Promises to Measurable Outcomes*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **data science, statistical modeling, and natural language processing (NLP)** to evaluate whether real-world institutional outcomes align with the **constitutional obligations defined in official government oaths**.

Public institutions in the United States—**military, law enforcement, judiciary, and civil government**—derive their authority from oaths sworn to the U.S. Constitution. While these oaths establish clear legal and ethical obligations, there is limited **quantitative research** measuring how closely institutional behavior aligns with those commitments.

This project addresses that gap by converting **normative legal principles into measurable signals** and comparing them against observed institutional outcomes.

## 🎯 Research Question

**Do institutional outcomes align with the constitutional obligations defined in official oaths?**

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters

- Converts normative constitutional law into **quantifiable metrics**
- Bridges **law, ethics, governance, and data science**
- Moves beyond anecdotal accountability toward **evidence-based oversight**
- Rarely studied quantitatively in academic or policy literature

**Relevant to:**
- Oversight bodies  
- Inspectors General  
- Civil rights organizations  
- Policy analysts  
- Academic researchers

**Interpretation**
- Large gaps between oath commitments and outcomes indicate **institutional misalignment**
- Collapsed outcome area signals **enforcement or accountability failure**
- Symmetry would indicate constitutional compliance

### 📉 Distribution of OOAS Across Agencies

**Insight**
- Left-skewed distributions highlight **systemic negative alignment**
- Outliers identify institutions requiring immediate oversight attention
