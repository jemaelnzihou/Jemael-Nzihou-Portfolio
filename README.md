### *From Constitutional Promises to Measurable Outcomes*

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **data science, statistical modeling, and natural language processing (NLP)** to evaluate whether real-world institutional outcomes align with the **constitutional obligations defined in official government oaths**.

Public institutions in the United States—**military, law enforcement, judiciary, and civil government**—derive their authority from oaths sworn to the U.S. Constitution.
